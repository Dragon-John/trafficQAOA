# Using Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (also called Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz) in a traffic context

Explores the optimization of the QAOA parameters and how this quantum algorithm may be used in near term quantum devices (NISQ era Quantum Computing).

The whole project is completed using qiskit on Jupyter notebooks.

You may skip parts of the guide depending on starting point, as this guide is designed to be understood from the very basics of quantum computing.
